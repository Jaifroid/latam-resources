                <p>This lecture is not intended to give you a compendium of
                  different film techniques. It's important that you be able to
                  manage the technical vocabulary of film, and there are plenty
                  of books that provide you with the vocabulary and explanations
                  you need. Here are some. My favourite is <i>New Vocabularies
                    in Film Semiotics</i> because it is particularly helpful to
                  those making the transition from literary-theoretical concepts
                  to those of film studies.</p>

                <p> I shall illustrate my points with a Mexican-Cuban film,
                  which lies unstably on the boundary between documentary and
                  fiction, <i>¿Quién diablos es Juliette?</i> (2000). </p>
                <p> <i>¿Quién diablos es Juliette? </i>was credited at the time
                  of its appearance with being the most locally and
                  internationally successful Mexican "documentary" to date in
                  terms of ticket sales and distribution. It was filmed in Cuba,
                  Mexico and the United States, and flamboyantly cuts across
                  national territories and mediatic genres in a way which defies
                  easy categorization. </p>
                <p> The film follows the parallel lives (although the parallels
                  are self-reflexively constructed within the film) between a
                  Cuban teenager, Yuliet Ortega, who lives in a marginal
                  district of La Habana, and a Mexican model who spends time in
                  New York, Fabiola Quiroz. The director and Fabiola had first
                  met Yuliet in La Habana in 1993 while they were on a video
                  shoot for a commissioned music video, Benny Ibarra’s hit
                  single <i>Tonto corazón</i>: </p>

                    <p>The film interweaves the story of the two women’s lives,
                      as told through interviews with friends and family as well
                      as the protagonists, with a highly playful and
                      self-reflexive visual style. It features a bewildering
                      away of forms of visual culture, from documentary
                      filmmaking, fiction film interpreted as feminist pedagogy,
                      the work of the Italian-American artist Francisco
                      Clemente, and photography. It is in many ways a reflexive
                      feast of visual culture which allows us to think about the
                      social role and function of such culture, as well as its
                      location between national cultures.</p>

                    <p>The story is largely constructed through flamboyant
                      editing, with the characters often appearing to be in
                      “dialogue” across impossibly vast territorial distances
                      and time frames. Since the narrative is an illusion
                      produced entirely through editing, and the film is aware
                      of this and comments on it, it is an extremely useful film

                    <p>Juliette is the European spelling of the romantic
                      cultural icon. It's displaced here by the popular,
                      hybridized, Cuban spelling (Yuliet). Deborah Martin, in an
                      article on the film, suggests that the linguistic slippage
                      here, together with many other such examples of linguistic
                      and visual punning in the film, “discourages any
                      spectatorial equation between visibility and truth”
                      [“Spectatorship, Performance, Resistance: Carlos
                      Marcovich's <i>¿Quién diablos es Juliette?</i>”, <i>Journal
                        of Latin American Cultural Studies: Travesia</i> 15, no.
                      3 (December 2006): 348].</p>
                    <p>This is vitally important, because the film sets itself
                      up as a true-life story, yet from the outset it flags the
                      power relationships embedded in language as well as in
                      visual culture. It strongly suggests that the <b>misnomer</b> (i.e.
                      misnaming) lies at the heart of all acts of
                      representation.</p>
                    <p>If you take ONE thing away from this lecture, I hope it's
                      this. It's something you must never forget in dealing with
                      film made on or about subaltern subjects. Such film is
                      always a misnomer, there is no transparency of
                      representation, visibility does NOT equal truth.</p>
                    <p>It's important to note that Yuliet corrects the
                      mis-spelling of her name, but that the misspelling
                      persists in the title of the film, and on the DVD
                      packaging, again emphasizing that the film does not
                      necessarily deal with the real Yuliet, but with a fictive
                      construction of her: Juliette.</p>
                    <p>Yuliet also makes clear here that these visual jokes are
                      scripted: they're the director's idea, not hers, calling
                      into question her power as a subaltern subject to resist
                      the film's construction of her.</p>

                      Yuliet's life. In the light of the fact that the whole

                        <p>Editing is the splicing together of shots to tell a

                          outrageous editing. Montage has two meanings, either
                          the superposition of two shots, so you see two images
                          in one frame, or it is used to indicate temporal
                          juxtaposition: a rapid cut or dissolve from one shot
                          to another produces a superposition in the spectator's

                          film theorists say that the film's discourse or
                          language -- i.e. film form -- produces the narrative,
                          and they often use the French: <i>discours</i> for
                          filmic language, and <i>histoire</i> for the narrative

                        <p>Genre is the term used to describe whether a film
                          belongs to a group or family of film types, such as
                          the thriller, Sci-Fi, film noir, etc. An important
                          thing to consider is what happens to some of these
                          genres when they travel: for example, is Latin
                          American Sci-Fi the same as US Sci-Fi, or does the
                          displacement produce a framing effect?</p>

                      Laura Mulvey. I am going to cite it at the beginning of

                    <p>'Woman as image, man as bearer of the look. In a world
                      ordered by sexual imbalance, pleasure in looking has been
                      split between active/male and passive/female. The
                      determining male gaze projects its fantasy onto the female
                      figure which is styled accordingly. In their traditional
                      exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and
                      displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual
                      and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote
                      to-be-looked-at-ness.'</p>

                      constructed as double or twin of the Mexican Fabiola
                      initially through the Benny Ibarra music video, and then
                      through a film which will engineer a re-encounter with her
                      father who had left Cuba when she was little, get her a
                      visa, and set her up with a Mexican modelling agency. Much
                      is made of the supposed likeness between Yuliet and
                      Fabiola, but for most of the film they are presented as
                      visually dissimilar, thus emphasizing the artificiality of
                      the parallels which erase the difference between the two
                      young women in the artificial space constructed by the
                      mass media.</p>
                    <p>Yet the director also attempts to "give" Yuliet some
                      feminist awareness about the situations it places her in.
                      An extended sequence deals with her reaction to seeing
                      Salma Hayek playing Alma in <i>El callejón de los milagros</i> (a
                      famous Mexican film about a young woman seduced into
                      semi-prostitution by false promises of a life of
                      glamour). Salma Hayek is also interviewed. The aim seems
                      to be to allow Yuliet to decide whether or not to insert
                      herself within the representational systems of the Mexican
                      fashion industry, following in the steps of Fabiola.</p>
                    <p>Needless to say, this blatant interventionism in the
                      girl’s life breaks most of the ethical, as well as
                      aesthetic, boundaries usually drawn within documentary
                      film-making; or, to put it another way, the film does not
                      disavow the interventionism which is inherent in the
                      unequal power relationships at the heart of
                      ethnographic-derived documentary.</p>

                      porque cuando uno lo proyecta en la pantalla se está
                      creyendo realmente lo que mira."</p>
                    <p>Please be VERY CAREFUL about how you use the words
                      "real", "realism", "authentic", "authenticity", "true" and
                      "truth" when writing about film, even documentary. Do not
                      use these words naively. They will almost always have to
                      be in quotation marks, and you should be critically
                      addressing the capacity of film to represent the "real".
                      Always remember that "realism" is an -ism, i.e. a style
                      that produces an <b>effect of the real</b>.</p>

                    <p>This also goes to the heart of the paradoxes of the
                      documentary film form.</p>
                    <p>One of the most influential theorists of documentary film
                      is Bill Nichols. These are some of the modes of
                      documentary he has identified: the <font size="1" color="#282828">
                        <span style=" font-size:9pt">expository, observational,
                          interactive, reflective, performative and poetic
                          modes.</span> </font> </p>
                    <p>The question of authenticity in documentary has been a
                      spectre haunting it from the earliest newsreel
                      re-enactment of battles for the camera onward. Most of the
                      battle footage from the turn of the twentieth century was
                      staged, including fake footage of key events in the
                      Spanish-American War of 1898 (enhanced by off-camera cigar
                      smoke) and the staging of battles by fully equipped mock
                      armies during the Boer War of 1899-1902. As is well known,
                      in Mexico much has been made of the inference that the
                      exigencies of the camera influenced the course of
                      historical events. Francisco Villa is purported to have
                      signed a contract for US$25,000 with the Mutual Film
                      Corporation in 1914 to film the battle of Ojinaga, in
                      which he granted exclusive film rights, allegedly promised
                      to fight whenever possible only during daylight hours, and
                      delayed fighting for the arrival of the cameramen.</p>
                    <p>In the documentary form, which developed out of such
                      reportage, the manipulation of documentary subjects to
                      produce reality effects at the core of the form’s generic
                      conventions. The oft-cited example is the fact that in the
                      first feature-length documentary, Robert Flaherty’s 1922
                      ethnographic film about the Inuit, <i>Nanook of the North</i>,
                      “a story of life and love in the actual Arctic” as the
                      film’s tag-line put it, much of the action was staged to
                      make it conform to preconceived notions of an “authentic”
                      Inuit way of life. </p>
                    <p>Recent theorization of documentary has charted the rise
                      of the “performative mode”, which establishes a tension,
                      Nichols suggests, “between performance and document":</p>

                <p> Another major point which I'd like you to be aware of
                  throughout your course is the "location of culture". </p>
                <p> The term is taken from Homi Bhabha's book of postcolonial
                  theory; and along with Bhabha, in the broadest sense of his
                  arguments, I'd like you never to forget that there is a
                  politics and a power surrounding the location of culture </p>
                <p> In relation to your own analyses of Ibero-American visual
                  culture, always ask yourself these kinds of questions: </p>

                    <p>In a discussion of Nancy Scheper-Hughes' study of infant
                      mortality in the slums of a sugar- plantation town in the
                      Brazilian Nordeste, the science studies theorist Donna
                      Haraway asks a series of disturbing questions about
                      visibility and invisibility:</p>
                    <p>"How is visibility possible? For whom, by whom, and of
                      whom? What remains invisible, to whom, and why? For those
                      peoples who are excluded from the visualizing apparatuses
                      of the disciplinary regimes of modern power-knowledge
                      networks, the averted gaze can be as deadly as the
                      all-seeing panopticon that surveys the subjects of the
                      biopolitical state."</p>
                    <p>A lot of Ibero-American visual culture is, I think,
                      raising such questions, especially where its subjects --
                      photographic, cinematic, artistic -- are people who are
                      usually excluded from the national or global gaze. Indeed,
                      we often have to face the paradox that the very apparatus
                      of visual culture is immersed in regimes of visibility and
                      invisibility. How can it, therefore, hope to trace the
                      invisible lives of those excluded from such regimes?</p>

              Conclusion: <i>Actual/actuar</i>
            </div>
            <div class="note-and-attributes"><span class="note">
                <p> The famous early critic of the documentary film form, John
                  Grierson, famously defined it as “the creative treatment of
                  actuality” [John Grierson, <i>Grierson on Documentary</i>,
                  Abridged ed (London: Faber, 1979), 35]. As we have seen, there
                  has always been a slippage between documentation and fiction,
                  between reference and fabulation, between the actorial and the
                  actual, at the heart of documentary debate and practice. This,
                  I think, is the meaning of this final clip from the film.</p>

                <p> <i>¿Quién diablos es Juliette?</i> situates itself
                  playfully in the gap between the illusion of immediacy, the <i>actual</i> or
                  here-and-now which haunts documentary, and <i>actuar</i> (acting),
                  the primacy of performance, the artificial construction of
                  reality effects. By emphasizing this slippage, the film is
                  able to point to all of the processes, systems and power
                  vectors involved in the construction of filmic subjects. It
                  also provides us with an understanding of the power of the
                  media to connect vast spatial and cultural differences in ways
                  that dissolve the local even as they construct new forms of
                  culture and identity. </p>
