Introduction</font></font>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="75%">
<p>The seventeenth-century poet Sor Juana In&eacute;s de la Cruz may not
for many of you be the most well-known writer on the Introduction to Hispanic
Texts course, and perhaps only a few of you will have thought of choosing
her as as a writer to work on in supervisions. So, in this lecture, I hope
to show you:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
why I think her work is <u>well worth</u> studying in depth</li>

<li>
something of the uniqueness of her poetry</li>

<li>
the relevance of her thinking today, particularly the appropriation of
her work that has been made for modern feminism.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
The title I have given this lecture is DIFFERENCE and INDIFFERENCE. Some
of the initial ideas I'd like to gather around these two poles are:
<blockquote>DIFFERENCE in the sense of
<blockquote>- sexual difference (she forces us to change the way in which
we read the canon of male writers)
<br>- linguistic difference (her work is not, as some have claimed, a mere
copy of contemporary Spanish styles)
<br>- socio-cultural difference (her work is not reducible to European
literature and themes)</blockquote>
INDIFFERENCE in the sense of
<blockquote>- a feminine strategy of resistance to male appropriation
<br>- denial of fixed sexual roles
<br>- a telling silence in her work on questions of theology and religion.</blockquote>
</blockquote>

Context</font></font>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="75%">
<br>Before going any further, however, it is necessary to give some sense
of a context for Sor Juana's poetry. You can gain a sense of this by watching
the film, <i>Yo la peor de todas</i>, made by the feminist Argentine director
Mar&iacute;a Luisa Bemberg (available in the language laboratory; see also
the video clip included on this website). This is a fairly accurate dramatization
of Octavio Paz's major study <i>Sor Juana In&eacute;s de la Cruz, o, las
trampas de la fe</i>, which remains the fullest account of her life and
work to date, and which you should dip into. I can only outline some of
the major points here:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Seventeenth-century Mexico, known then as Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, was a highly
autocratic society, ruled by viceroys sent from Spain and rotated in practice
every seven or eight years.</li>

<li>
The arch-bishop held great power, and the Santo Oficio, or Holy Inquisition,
was greatly feared (Sor Juana mentions it in a famous letter, saying that
she does not wish to get into trouble with it).</li>

<li>
The religious climate of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a was much more orthodox than
in Spain: Catholicism was a well implanted religion in Spain, but in the
Americas it was relatively new.</li>

<li>
The colonial state was highly centralized:</li>

<ul>
<li>
the indigenous people were governed by specific laws, and there were special
statutes for different ethnic groups -- blacks, mulattoes, indians, mestizos,
creoles, and Spaniards</li>

<li>
religious orders were governed by specific laws, as were virtually all
different social groups</li>

<li>
ownership of land was strictly controlled -- much was owned by the Church,
while the state was interested in preventing the rise of large, powerful,
creole land-owners who might represent a source of antagonism to the rule
of Spain.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Mexico City had a population of roughly 100,000, of which 20,000 were Spaniards
and creoles, and 80,000 were indigenous, mestizos, and mulattoes.</li>

<ul>
<li>
It was the centre of education, with the University, only open to men,
founded in 1551.</li>

<li>
It was the seat of the viceregal Court, rivaled in importance only by
the court of the Viceroyalty of Per&uacute; in Lima.</li>
</ul>

<li>
The Court was the centre of the moral, literary and aesthetic codes and
conventions, and it is impossible to understand Sor Juana's poetry without
realizing its importance:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Octavio Paz says that, of the three central institutions of the country
-- the University, the Church, and the Court -- the Court represented an
aesthetic and vital way of life, a "dramatic ballet whose characters were
the human passions, from the sensual to the ambitious, dancing to a strict
yet elegant geometry" (in <i>Sor Juana In&eacute;s de la Cruz, o, las trampas
de la fe</i>).</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
One of the major themes of Sor Juana's work is knowledge, and in particular the
right of women to have access to learning. In the context of seventeenth-century
New Spain, however, knowledge is a dangerous commodity and one that is carefully
controlled by the religious hierarchy, rigorously policed by the Holy
Inquisition. Scientific knowledge poses a threat to the basis of religious
power, as does any interpretation of Scripture that runs counter to the
prevailing orthodoxy. In the hands of a woman, any claim to knowledge is triply
suspect because access to knowledge of the &quot;Divine Order&quot; (whether
scientific or theological) is strictly mediated through a patriarchal hierarchy
of men. It is hardly surprising, then, to find that Sor Juana's meditations on
knowledge are peppered throughout her work with silence, hermeticism, and
contradiction.
<p>
The Court, in which Sor Juana spent four years of her adolescence, was
the point of contact with Europe and European aristocratic culture; the Church
was the controller and censor of knowledge and culture as ideological
instruments, and was at times in conflict with the more liberal atmosphere of
the Court. Sor Juana's work negotiates a precarious feminine space between these
competing institutions. For the culture they controlled was almost entirely a masculine culture. <b>Its writers were men
and its readers were men. The doors of the educational institutions were
entirely locked for women. This is why it is so extraordinary that the
greatest writer to emerge from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, the first great poet
of Spanish America, should have been a woman.</b><a href="#top"><img SRC="arrow_marble_up.gif" ALT="back to contents" BORDER=0 height=30 width=30 align=RIGHT></a>
