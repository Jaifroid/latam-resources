<p><br>CRITICAL WORKS:
<p>The most complete study of Sor Juana's life and work to date is by the
famous Mexican poet Octavio Paz, entitled <i>Sor Juana In&eacute;s de la
Cruz, o, Las trampas de la fe</i>(M&eacute;xico:
Fondo de Cultura Econ&oacute;mica, 1982). The UL has two or three copies
of this, some in English (eg., 743.31.c.95.116). References to further
critics, in particular the work of Dorothy Schons, can be found there.<p>For an
account of feminist approaches to Sor Juana's work, see Stephanie Merrim, ed., <i>Feminist
Perspectives on Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</i> (Detroit: Wayne State University
Press, 1991). Faculty Library: LAM7.JUAN.202.
<p>For an extensive analysis of the <i>Primero sueño</i>, see Aída Beaupied's <i>Narciso
hermético: Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz y José Lezama Lima</i> (Liverpool:
Liverpool University Press, 1997).<p>There is an <a
href="http://libtext.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/IbrAmerTxt/IbrAmerTxt-idx?type=header&amp;byte=110983">online</a>
version of a book by critic Ermilo Abreu Gómez, <i><a
href="http://libtext.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/IbrAmerTxt/IbrAmerTxt-idx?type=header&amp;byte=110983">Semblanza
de Sor Juana</a></i> (1938). Although an important reading of her work, beware
that it uses certain critical assumptions which are now very dated..<i><a href="#top"><img SRC="arrow_marble_up.gif" ALT="back to contents" BORDER=0 align=RIGHT width="30" height="30"></a></i>

<p>KEY DATES (following new research by Octavio Paz):
<p>1648: Juana In&eacute;s Ram&iacute;rez born as illegitimate daughter
into a poor family on the farmstead of San Miguel Nepantla;
<br>1656: Sent to live with maternal aunt's family in M&eacute;xico (City);
learnt Latin;
<br>1664: Enters the Court (aged 16); lionized as prodigy and for her beauty;
<br>1668: Enters Convent of San Jer&oacute;nimo (aged 20); wrote many poems,
plays, studied philosophy, music and science;
<br>1691: Writes famous 'Respuesta a Sor Filotea', defending right of women
to study and write; comes under pressure from Ecclesiastical hierarchy
to abandon her studies;
<br>1694: Abjures under great pressure; forced to sell her books and musical
and scientific instruments;
<br>1695: Plague hits convent; Sor Juana contracts plague and dies 17th
April, aged 46.
<p>Juana In&eacute;s Ram&iacute;rez was born in 1648 on the farmstead of
San Miguel Nepantla on the slopes of the Popocat&eacute;petl volcano, some
60km from the capital of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a (now M&eacute;xico). She was
the 'illegitimate' daughter of a criolla mother (Do&ntilde;a Isabel Ram&iacute;rez
de Santillana) and a Biscayan father (Pedro Manuel de Asbaje), and her
four sisters and a brother (some of them by a different father) were also
illegitimate.
<p>She learnt to read very early (apparently when she was three) and by
all accounts had a voracious appetite for knowledge -- she claims to have
read all her grandfather's books before she went to the capital, and these
seem to have included many classic works. She herself said that when she
was six or seven, her desire for learning was so intense that she begged
her mother to let her dress up in men's clothes and allow her to go and
study in Mexico University, which only men were allowed to attend. When
she was eight (in 1656), she was sent to M&eacute;xico (i.e., Ciudad M&eacute;xico)
to live with her maternal aunt and the latter's husband, Juan de Mata,
possibly on account of the death of her grandfather and the birth of her
half brother. There we know that she took a mere twenty lessons in Latin
grammar, which enabled her to read philosophical and theological works
in the language, and she came to be considered as something of a child
prodigy. She began to be lionized in high society for her intelligence
and also for her famed beauty.
<p>When she was sixteen (in 1664), the Matas presented her to the court
of the new viceroy, where she won the affections of the vicereine, Do&ntilde;a
Leonor Carreto, Marquesa de Mancera, and was admitted into her service.
She lived in the court from the age of sixteen to the age of twenty. She
developed an incredible talent for versification, and was able to hold
her own in matters of learning with theologians, mathematicians, philosophers
and men of letters. She no doubt had to defend herself from the amorous
advances of the married men of the court, yet even had she desired to marry
(she later declared that she rejected the very idea), there was little
chance for her within that society, being illegitimate and from a poor
family.
<p>At the age of nineteen she temporarily entered the convent of San Jos&eacute;
de las Carmelitas Descalzas, but withdrew, probably shocked by the severity
of that Order. Just before her twentieth birthday she took her vows and
entered the convent of San Jer&oacute;nimo, where she remained for the
rest of her life. There she had her own library and study, and was able
to hold tertulias (sitting behind bars) with men of learning from the Court
and University. She wrote many poems and plays, was adept at music, and
studied all branches of knowledge, from philosophy to natural science.
<p>When the new Viceroy, the Marqu&eacute;s de la Laguna arrived in 1680,
Sor Juana struck up a friendship with his wife Mar&iacute;a Luisa, condesa
de Paredes, addressed as Lisi or L&iacute;sida in the many love poems addressed
to her. The viceregal couple remained in M&eacute;xico until 1688, and
when they left, Sor Juana lost the protection which they had provided:
for, while being eulogized by many, Sor Juana was also the butt of misogynistic
attacks. These came into the open when in 1690 a letter of hers criticizing
a famous sermon by a Jesuit priest was published without her permission
by one 'Sor Filotea de la Cruz', a curious feminine pseudonym adopted by
her supposed friend the Bishop of Puebla, Manuel Fern&aacute;ndez de Santa
Cruz. This was accompanied by a letter written by the Bishop (under the
assumed female name) admonishing her for her preoccupation with worldly
affairs and for the lack of biblical subjects in her poetry and study.
Sor Juana wrote an energetic reply, the famous 'Respuesta a Sor Filotea',
which has been hailed as the first feminist manifesto. The Ecclesiastical
hierarchy, however, particularly the Archbishop Aguiar y Seijas, began
to attack her more openly, demanding that she renounce her books and all
worldly study. She continued to publish, and wrote a group of eight villancicos
on the life of St Catharine of Alexandria some of which have a defiant
feminist tone.
<p>Floods hit Ciudad M&eacute;xico in 1691, followed by famine in 1692.
Besieged by criticism, and under great pressure even from her confessor,
Sor Juana began what appears to have been a process of forced abjuration.
There is no evidence of her actually renouncing her devotion to letters,
and all the documents of 1694 to which she supposedly put her name have
the tone of mere rhetorical formulae. However, she was forced to sell all
her books, an extensive library of some 4,000 volumes, as well as her musical
and scientific instruments. In April of 1695, a plague hit the convent,
with great loss of life. While looking&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img SRC="arrow_marble_up.gif" ALT="back to contents" BORDER=0 align=RIGHT width="30" height="30"></a>after
her sick sisters, she contracted the disease and died at four in the morning
of 17th April, aged 46 years and five months. In the convent's <i>Libro
de profesiones</i> she had signed a statement of self-humiliation with
the words 'Yo, la peor del mundo'.
