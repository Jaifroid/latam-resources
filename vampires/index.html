    <h2 style="margin-top:0in">Preamble </h2>

    <p class="MsoNormal">I approach the theme of vampires and the living dead in 
    cinema with some trepidation, not only because it's the right time of year 
    for them to be popping out of their coffins and peeping invisibly into our 
    mirrors, but also because I know that this is a theme with a long history in 
    cultures in which I have little expertise. So as to dispel any illusions 
    from the outset, I am not going to say anything very new about the cultural 
    and cinematic significance of Dracula, vampires, golems, and so on, but I 
    am, hopefully, going to show you some of the exciting permutations which 
    these take on in the cinematography of late twentieth-century Mexico, as 
    part of an on-going study of the re-configurations of late-modern and 
    postmodern urban culture in that haunted and distorting mirror which 
    Europeans often see when they look at Latin America. </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">I am particularly fascinated 
    by what happens when the late-modern themes of dolls, mannequins, vampires, 
    and the undead, in the nightmare of the metropolis, encounter the postmodern 
    theme of the cyborg or &quot;cybernetic organism&quot;. Of course the staging, quite 
    literally, of such an encounter is already prefigured in that 
    quint­essentially modernist cinematic text,<i>Metropolis</i>of 1926. 
    Postmodern cyborgs, however, are more modular: the machine does not 
    substitute for the organic as its nightmare, roboticized double; machine and 
    organism are instead multiply interfaced in complex networks in whose 
    entangled threads we can read, amongst many other things, dramatic stories 
    about the technological production of nature, the conflictual implantation 
    of global power-knowledge systems, the gendering of bodies within the 
    reproductive and replicative scenarios of biotechnology, and the recursive 
    materialization and de-materialization of bodies across the televisual 
    information horizon. The theorist who has most deployed the cyborg figure in 
    her work is of course Donna J. Haraway, and as will be obvious to most of 
    you in the course of this paper, my own thinking about the relationship of 
    the body to postmodern technologies is heavily indebted to her work, in 
    particular her most recent book with the amazing title<i>Modest_Witness@Second_Millenium.FemaleMan©_ 
    Meets_OncoMouseT</i>, as well as her earlier book that introduced the figure 
    of the cyborg,<i>Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature</i>.
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">Cyborgs are no mere fantasy 
    science-fiction images, although science fiction is often itself the best 
    guide to popular anxieties about globalization, difference, and high 
    technology. For examples of fully integrated, cute little cyborgs you need 
    look no further than the popular television series for toddlers, the<i>Teletubbies</i>. 
    Here's one I made earlier, and you'll note that it has a television screen 
    firmly located in its stomach, and an aerial in place of antennae growing 
    out of the head. What better way to prepare children for their future role 
    as televisually mediated subjects, their bodies organically interfaced with 
    the visual information economy? Eyes glued to the television screen, they 
    receive a recursive image of a body reduced metonymically to television set 
    through which the embodied life-stories of other children are in turn 
    recursively mediated. Well, maybe you'll be relieved to know that good old 
    Barbie is still as popular as ever. But I want to situate my paper somewhere 
    between the gendered dolls of yesteryear and the hybridized cyborgs of 
    today, with a few vampires thrown in the middle. </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">My title, then, refers to the 
    spatio-temporal breach where dolls, vampires, and cyborgs can co-exist 
    across the violently foreclosed historical narratives that might otherwise 
    separate them. And one paradigmatic version of such a spatio-temporal breach 
    might be Mexico City in the 1980s and 90s, one of the largest cities on 
    earth, yet peripheral enough to be subject to the violent swings of 
    speculative investment, its aggressive postmodernity cut through with the 
    shattered fragments of a stalled modernity. Michael Watts cites the Catalan 
    urban geographer Manuel Castells to the effect that &quot;the 
    internationalization of post-war capitalism has produced a lived experience 
    in which 'the space of flows . supersede[s] the space of places'&quot;. He goes 
    on to argue: </p>

    <p class="quotation">[Q1] one can productively situate [this] local-global 
    conundrum on the wider canvas of the production of capitalist space [.]. 
    Periods of accelerated change and reconfiguration within capitalism - the 
    'creative' [.] destruction of everything it cannot use - produce what 
    geographers have referred to as space-time convergence [.]. The erosion [.] 
    of the glorious age of post-war Fordism, and its displacement by some form 
    of flexible [.] accumulation, represents in this context the most recent 
    modulation in a recursive, wave-like pattern of space-time compressions. 
    (Watts, 492). </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Such space-time implosion, in a city heavy with the 
    signs of the past, as is Mexico City, seems to short-circuit ordered 
    temporal narratives, projecting them out onto its surface. At the best of 
    times, cities in Latin America are beset by fevers of demolition and 
    reconstruction, as new investment money tries to liquidate old assets and 
    speculators awash with over-accumulated capital from US, European, or 
    Japanese markets, attempt to realize higher profits by making quick 
    investments in the Third World, which they are just as quick to withdraw at 
    the slightest hint of trouble. This process is exacerbated, in the case of 
    one of the films we shall be examining today, by the catastrophe of the 
    earthquake which hit Mexico City on September 19<sup>th</sup>, 1985. The 
    massive destruction to the urban infrastructure, let alone the huge loss of 
    life, nevertheless becomes the occasion for a full-scale construction boom 
    as capital takes advantage of a natural form of liquidation of 
    over-accumulated stock. Donna Haraway makes a suggestive link to vampire 
    mythology of this kind of creative destruction when she writes that &quot;any 
    expanding capitalist society [.] must continually destroy what it builds and 
    feed off every being it perceives as natural-if its strategies of 
    accumulation of wealth are to continue to push the envelope of catastrophe&quot; 
    (<i>Modest_Witness</i>, 214). </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">Yet such processes are not 
    only economic. Many commentators, from our own Anthony Giddens&nbsp;to Brazil's 
    Renato Ortiz&nbsp;have stressed that the culture industries of late modernity are 
    constitutive rather than merely reflective of deterritorialization processes 
    such as disembedding and time-space distanciation. In other words, culture 
    itself, and audiovisual culture in particular - which forms one of the 
    central reflexive institutions of late modernity - are complicit in the 
    reordering of time and space which aligns the local with the global. This 
    was certainly true of cinema in its heyday in Latin America, and we should 
    not forget that Mexico's Golden Age of cinema in the 1940s and '50s was a 
    mass, popular phenomenon. At the level of disembedding, its effects were 
    twofold: on the one hand it helped in the consolidation of the 
    post-revolutionary nation, disembedding the popular imagination from its 
    enmeshing with the local community and re-inscribing it within the larger 
    framework of a newly consolidating popular national consciousness; on the 
    other hand, as an industry it was fundamentally tied into global circuits of 
    symbolic exchange, highly influenced by Hollywood domination of the medium, 
    and so prepared the ground for the full-scale deterritorializing onslaught 
    of television. To what degree the same can be said of the cinema industry 
    today, largely in crisis in Latin America, to a great extent depends on the 
    market penetration of the films, but the fundamental point that cinema 
    partakes of the very processes is responds to still remains. </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">Mexican commentators such as 
    the social anthropologist Néstor García Canclini&nbsp;tend to focus more 
    specifically on the local-global dialectic as it is enacted in the Mexican 
    megapolis as a paradigm for Latin American urbanization and globalization. 
    In the mega city, forms of local community can only exist in fragmented 
    isolation from an unknowable, unnarratable, unmappable whole. The city's 
    fabric is split and disseminated, through globally driven processes of 
    territorial expansion and multiple waves of migration, into many splintered 
    cities: the historic city, the industrial city, village cities, migrant 
    cities, globalized information and finance cities. While the knowable 
    community, to use Raymond Williams' term, is atomized, the dominant 
    experience of fragmentation is compensated for, he argues, by the illusory 
    audiovisual community of the mass media. So, what interests me here is the 
    way in which we experience the dissemination of our bodies into a violently 
    globalized and televisually mediated urban space, and the kinds of 
    recombinatory strategies we develop to counter such fragmentation. </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">More central to our purposes, 
    García Canclini qualifies the role of the culture industries in this 
    re-articulation of the local and the global. He claims that these industries 
    are implicated in the<u>dual</u>process of transnationalization, or 
    deterritorialization, and the folkloric preservation of local culture 
    through the fiction of national and supra-national difference. At the level 
    of Latin America the marketing phenomenon of magic realism, from Gabriel 
    García Márquez through Isabel Allende to Laura Esquivel, might be the name 
    of one such reading-off of Latin American difference and heterogeneity, 
    reified as a sanctuary of pre-modern nature precisely<u>for</u>the 
    postmodern readership of a globalized and homogenizing cultural market 
    (García Canclini, 94). At the level of the city, however, paradoxically less 
    mappable than the broad brushstrokes of magic realist Latin America, the 
    æsthetics of the modernist<i>flâneur</i>often give way to those of the 
    television advertisement and video clip, transcultural citation, and 
    cultural hybridization. </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">If this seems to be leading 
    us some way from mannequins, dolls, vampires and cyborgs, let's remember 
    that the vampire as prototype of the modernist and postmodernist use of 
    these figures encodes multiple fears about hybridization, racial-cum-sexual 
    pollution, the corruption of virginal 'nature', and the transfusion of body 
    into simulacrum - the latter being one of the reasons why the vampire has 
    had such cinematic resonance. I cite as evidence of this, the French urban 
    philosopher Henri Lefebvre's account of the emptying of body into image 
    within the urbanization of capital: </p>

    <p class="quotation">[Q2] Living bodies, the bodies of 'users' - are caught 
    up not only in the toils of parcellized space, but also in the web of what 
    philosophers call 'analogons': images, signs and symbols. These bodies are 
    transported out of themselves, transferred and emptied out, as it were, via 
    the eyes: every kind of appeal, incitement and seduction is mobilized to 
    tempt them with doubles of themselves in prettified, smiling and happy 
    poses; and this campaign to void them succeeds exactly to the degree that 
    the images proposed correspond to 'needs' that those same images have helped 
    fashion. So it is that a massive influx of information, of messages, runs 
    head on into an inverse flow constituted by the evacuation from the 
    innermost body of all life and desire. (Lefebvre <a name="Tmp"></a>, 98) 
    [This is exactly how I feel when I open my e-mail every morning] </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">However, before taking these ideas further in relation 
    to the Mexican vampire movie, I want to return to the related, very 
    modernist, theme of the doll and the mannequin, which in the temporal 
    compressions of Mexico City can co-exist with postmodern cybernetics, and 
    here, at last, in a moment, is my first clip. </p>

    <h2>Dolls, mannequins, and mirrors </h2>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The first film I want to look at is<i>Íntimo terror</i>(&quot;Intimate 
    Terror&quot; translated by the subtitlers as &quot;Secret Fear&quot;), directed by the 
    Mexican poet Walter Doehner Pecanins, and based on a story by Armando 
    Cuspinera. It was produced in 1990 but is set in 1987 in the aftermath of 
    the great earthquake which shook Mexico City on September 19<sup>th</sup>, 
    1985. The film emerges from a sense of the social and physical collapse of 
    the infrastructure of Mexican urban society, and includes in the credit 
    sequence archive footage of the many collapsed buildings that killed so many 
    thousands of people. The earthquake caused heavy damage in particular to 
    multi-storey housing, which often collapsed like cardboard, burying dead, 
    and alive some 20,000 people, including the Juárez hospital in which there 
    were about 3,000 fatalities. As I mentioned, demolition and reconstruction 
    of the urban environment became much more pronounced in the years following 
    the earthquake, so that in this film, the sense of urban catastrophe, 
    infused into the terrible nightmares which come to destroy a woman's life, 
    is given a tangible image that appears to short-circuit the representational 
    apparatus of cinema let alone the parallel and recursive representational 
    apparatus of dreams. </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">The film concerns a young 
    childless couple, Pablo and Luisa, who find a place to rent after being 
    forced to live with Pablo's mother when their apartment was destroyed in the 
    earthquake. Their lives are apparently tranquil - Luisa hopes to return to 
    her writing, which she had stopped at the time of the earthquake, while 
    Pablo goes off to work each day in local administration - but beneath this 
    surface normality, a series of strange events and obsessions begin to 
    emerge, centred on an antique wardrobe with its mirror, in which Luisa 
    begins to witness a terrible crime from the past unfolding. In some ways the 
    film takes the earthquake as a metaphor for the ceaseless repression of 
    history within urban space, a process that is largely unplanned and uneven 
    in Mexico City, and enacts a kind of psychic return of the dead. The 
    clip&nbsp;below is from the beginning of the film, and shows the first meeting of 
    the couple with the owner of the house which they want to rent. This is a 
    compilation of clips which I've edited, the first showing (in 
    black-and-white) some of the archive footage of the demolition work after 
    the earthquake, then the opening scene showing the couple standing at the 
    door - and note the rigidity of the camera mirroring the rigidity of their 
    faces and dialogue, as if they were zombies acting out someone else's 
    script. We then see their first look around the house, cutting&nbsp; to 
    Luisa exploring upstairs where she comes across an old wardrobe with an oval 
    mirror. You'll have to keep your eyes peeled here to see a very brief but 
    startling double cross-cut as Luisa gets a glimpse of some<i>other</i>reality 
    or other time reflected in the mirror. I then cut the clip to a later 
    sequence where Luisa, out walking through the derelict city, comes across 
    the house of the sinister don Agustín, and is invited in.]</span> </p>

    at the beginning of the clip the tailors' dummy - just the torso with no 
    arms or legs or head - in the entrance hall of the house, already figuring 
    the substitution and displacement of bodies even before the theme of the 
    doll is made explicit, condensing as it does motifs of doubling, 
    engendering, sterility, surrogacy, and recursion. At the end of the clip, 
    when Luisa is trying to choose one of the dolls which don Agustín has 
    offered her, her head is framed by the mirror at the back of the exhibition 
    case in such a way that an analogy is suggested between herself and the 
    dolls as specular doubles. The doll that she chooses is dressed in similar 
    clothes to a nightmare woman, double of herself perhaps, or murderess from 
    the past, whom she will later glimpse in the mirror of her wardrobe. </p>

    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:17.85pt">
    The figure of the doll, like the trope of the return of the dead, has a 
    strong presence in Mexican and indeed Latin American literature, deriving 
    from the huge influence of surrealism and modernist thought in general on 
    writers such as Julio Cortázar and Carlos Fuentes, as well as from the 
    hybridization of Christian and indigenous myth systems. Their use of such 
    figures as paradigms of textual doubling, the doubling enacted within 
    textual representation and in the case of Fuentes in the implantation of 
    European symbolic and scriptural systems in Latin America, is more involved 
    than in the films we're looking at here. However what I am conjecturing to 
    be different about the way in which both films deploy these high modernist 
    themes is in their placing of the doll/ zombie/ undead figure at the 
    threshold of the failure of representation, as figures of a phase change, of 
    the spatio-temporal boundary where representational logic phases into and 
    out of an order of simulation. Or rather, both films project and encode the 
    fears and desires generated in the superimposition of these states, although 
    in somewhat different ways. </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><i>Íntimo terror</i>, I take 
    to be a film governed by a largely modernist sense of temporal compression, 
    with the fears that it encodes centring on the entrapment of bodies in the 
    time warps of the unevenly modernized city. Henri Lefebvre sees it as a 
    defining characteristic of<i>modernity</i>that the traces of time inscribed 
    in natural space are made to &quot;vanish&quot; from the urban scene, are atomized, 
    consumed, used up, and &quot;spent&quot;. Present only as fragmented remains, 
    flattened out onto the face of a clock, the shards of organic or cyclical 
    time are swept away with the debris of the city, only to return through the 
    gaps and fissures opened up in the earthquake, the devastation of the urban 
    infrastructure in a cityscape now haunted by the absence of those buried 
    beneath its rubble. Moreover, the motif of the doll draws out a gendered 
    dimension to the way urban space is experienced and inhabited, as the film 
    lays great emphasis on Luisa's crumbling sense of her own identity. Caught 
    between the domestic chores her husband expects of her, her childlessness, 
    and her failure to commence the novel which she is supposed to be writing - 
    to compose any meaningful narrative projection of herself -, she becomes 
    possessed by the story of jealousy and murderous revenge she sees unfolding 
    in the mirror of her bedroom, while the breakdown of her own self-coherence 
    mirrors the shattered urban environment through which she has to make her 
    way every day to do the shopping. I think I'll show another clip now which 
    highlights some of these ideas. The clip begins in the meat market, where 
    Luisa is doing her shopping and comes face to face with the machine-like 
    processing of death in the city as the carcasses of animals are being 
    gruesomely prepared for consumption. I then cut to her next visit to don 
    Agustín, where they talk about their experiences of the earthquake with 
    frighteningly blank expressions. After a terrifying run through the derelict 
    city, we see her at home, trying to write, and failing, with the doll on her 
    desk, when she gets up to look in the mirror.</span> </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:17.85pt">Film 
    figuring writing, and in particular failed, disturbed, or pathological 
    writing, almost always does so as a citational image, a simulation of the 
    breakdown of coherent narratives in the passage from representation to 
    simulation. As an example, think of David Fincher's cult horror film<i>Seven</i>(1995), 
    where the murderer's pathological writings extend to millions of words, a 
    whole library full of indecipherable jottings, which the New York police 
    department will need weeks to sift through to find any meaningful clues. The 
    text no longer signifies as a narrative capable of being deciphered, 
    mirroring, in its bewildering excess, the breakdown of the detective story 
    paradigm whereby the detective is supposed to be the master reader who sorts 
    out all the dispersed narratives of the case. Returning to<i>Íntimo terror</i>, 
    just as the city is inhabited by haunted voices, moanings, and groanings, as 
    if the victims of the earthquake were still down there, buried alive, so 
    Luisa's body is possessed by a narrative not of her own conscious choosing. 
    The film builds up to a truly horrendous conclusion as Luisa slowly takes on 
    the identity of, and is possessed by, her double. Don Agustín gives her more 
    and more presents, each one an item of clothing or jewellery that will cause 
    her to resemble ever more closely the woman in the mirror. In the mirror, 
    she sees a man who looks like her husband arguing violently with the woman, 
    and then sees her husband making love with a woman called Sirenia who lives 
    in the neighbourhood. Believing that she is being pursued, she seeks refuge 
    in don Agustín's house, where, to her horror, she finds the same Sirenia she 
    had seen in the mirror. Suspecting that she is going to be murdered by don 
    Agustín, she manages to give him the slip, and after a panic-stricken 
    stumble through the ruined night-time streets, comes across a woman dressed 
    exactly as herself apparently sleep-walking through the streets with a pair 
    of scissors in her hand. Luisa runs into her house and upstairs to her bed. 
    Suddenly the woman from the street, who is the woman in the mirror, opens 
    the bedroom door, and, brandishing the scissors, plunges them towards the 
    camera. Abruptly Luisa wakes up, to find herself in her nightdress in her 
    bedroom, with her husband in bed next to her. She has blood on her hands. 
    She tries to wake her husband, pulls off the sheets, to find him lying in a 
    pool of blood, the pair of scissors buried in his chest [please see the 
    stills provided on the handout]. </p>

    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Well, I will resist interpreting the 
    conjunction - which could come straight out of a textbook on 
    psychoanalytical film theory - of writing, a mirror, and a pair of scissors 
    in this film, because such conjunctions are almost a cliché of Mexican 
    literature thanks to Carlos Fuentes. I think the film is doing something 
    else - as if this ending were not horrendous enough, the scene now cuts to a 
    couple standing in front of the door of the house, knocking on the door, 
    newspaper in hand. The door is opened by don Agustín who tells this new 
    couple that they are too late to rent the house because he has found a 
    buyer. They persuade him to let them look around, and so the story is 
    repeated as a new couple comes to take the place of Pablo and Luisa. In a 
    sense the film begins again, with new actors saying the same lines. In an 
    album lying open on don Agustín's coffee table we see a photograph of Luisa 
    and Pablo, alongside photographs of many other couples. The recursive bodies in the recursive narrative of 
    this film end up as so many celluloid simulations. </p>

    <h2>Vampires and cyborgs </h2>

    <p class="quotation">[Q3] the vampire: the one who pollutes lineages on the 
    wedding night; the one who effects category transformations by illegitimate 
    passages of substance; the one who drinks and infuses blood in a 
    paradigmatic act of infecting whatever poses as pure; [.] the one who is 
    undead, unnatural, and perversely incorruptible. [.] For better of for 
    worse, vampires are vectors of category transformation in a racialized, 
    historical, national unconscious (Haraway, &quot;Race. Universal Donors in a 
    Vampire Culture: It's All in the Family&quot;, 216). </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">I now move on to my second horror film,<i>Cronos</i>, a 
    postmodern urban vampire movie with a twist, whose title indicates a similar 
    obsession with time, but whose narrative simulates much more so than<i>Íntimo 
    terror</i>, the violent compression of the archaic, the modern, and the 
    hyper- or post-modern. In this film of 1992 by the young Guadalajaran 
    director Guillermo del Toro, the vampire co-exists with the cyborg in a 
    spatial dimension simultaneously infused with time and bereft of temporal 
    difference, as, once more, representational space dissolves into simulation. 
    The film was designed from the outset for a globalized audience, being 
    co-produced by Iguana Productions and Los Ángeles-based Ventana Films, 
    containing a mixture of Spanish and English, and using an international cast 
    of Argentine Federico Luppi, Hollywood actor Ron Perlman, as well as Mexican 
    actors of course. As Ann Marie Stock argues, &quot;Neither del Toro nor<i>Cronos</i>is 
    'obsessed' with authentic national culture. In fact, they flaunt their 
    migrancy and hybridity&quot; (xxvi). Yet the film also seems to encode, or at 
    least play with, the anxiety produced in the pollution of frontiers. This, 
    then, is an important example of the way in which post-national visual 
    culture both reflects and partakes of disembedding processes. </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">So straight into the first 
    clip, which is self-explanatory because it is from the opening of the film -

    [Total: 16m35s] </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Well, as you see, the film concerns an Argentine 
    antiques dealer in Mexico City called Jesús Gris, played by the Argentine 
    actor Federico Luppi, who accidentally injects himself with the Chronos 
    Device. This clockwork machine, we are told in a pre-credit sequence, was 
    invented round about 1536 by the alchemist Humberto Fulcanelli, chief 
    watch-maker of the viceroy of New Spain, as Mexico was known in Colonial 
    times, who also wrote a book detailing the strict rules that have to be 
    followed in the use of the device. As we saw at the beginning of the film, 
    Jesús's house stands out from the modern buildings around it, or is rather 
    dwarfed by them, an incongruous bit of the past in a Mexico city of fast 
    traffic, multi-lingual signposts, and the litter of Christmas shopping 
    strewn on chaotic streets, overlain in a typical piece of postmodern 
    pastiche, with an Argentine tango. Both films' obsession with antiques, with 
    fragments of broken stories from the past welling up through them, is 
    coupled with a bewildering setting of uneven and unplanned urban development 
    that leaves shards of time lying around the city's broken fabric. </p>

    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in">But the Chronos device is not just a machine: at its 
    very core, in amongst its intricate mechanical cogs, lies a blood-sucking 
    insect as we'll see later, a sort of bio-filter, that confers eternal life 
    on the person injected by it. [See stills on handout] </p>

    in increasing doses, and creates in the person who uses it an irresistible 
    craving for ever larger quantities of human blood. In short, Jesús Gris, 
    respectable upright grandfather, finds himself transformed, by stages, into 
    an intravenous drug user, then a haemophiliac, until finally, his body 
    mutating slowly into that of a monstrous insect, he becomes a simulated 
    postmodern vampire. I say simulated because, as you will have gathered from 
    the way I describe this transformation, the film quotes just about every 
    classic horror movie and Hollywood body ripper that it's possible to fit 
    into a single film, from Hitchcock's<i>Rear Window</i>to Cronenberg's 
    re-make of<i>The Fly</i>, from<i>Nosferatu</i>to<i>Videodrome</i>. For a

    A machine part mechanism part organism, with a body of sorts plugged into 
    its whirling shafts and gears, already evokes in a frightening temporal 
    rift, a pre-modern prototype cyborg adrift in a completely irresolvable 
    postmodern timeframe. The Chronos device seems to telescope narratives as 
    apparently distinct as colonization (it is invented at the dawn of the 
    Spanish Empire in the Americas), AIDS hysteria (Jesús Gris's body decomposes 
    the more he uses the device), the earliest forms of mechanization (the 
    invention of clocks which enabled synchronization over large distances), 
    techno-organic kinship (a kind of super dialysis machine), and biotechnology 
    and genetic engineering (Jesús's body mutates into that of an insect). If I 
    insist on the biomedical paradigm, it is because it is heavily signalled in 
    the film. Jesús, it emerges, is not the only one to know about the existence 
    of the Chronos device. A dying capitalist millionaire, owner, it is implied, 
    of huge industrial wealth, who has had most of his bodily organs surgically 
    removed due to slow-spreading cancer, has found the old alchemist's book, 
    and sends his nephew, Ángel de la Guardia, searching around Mexico City for 
    angels of the type you saw the Chronos device hidden in during that clip, 
    since he wants to use the device to cure himself of his incurable disease. 
    In this next clip, we see the industrial warehouse at the top of which the 
    old Señor Dieter de la Guardia lives in a hermetically sealed high-tech 
    environment. Note here the film's bilingualism, since the nephew Ángel, 
    prefers to speak English, evocative of a postmodern, transculturally 
    hybridized space:&lt; /span&gt; </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:17.85pt">One might 
    say something similar about the condensed narratives at work here to what 
    Haraway says about the Lynn Randolph picture,<i>Transfusions</i>, which I 
    have put on the front of your handout: </p>

    <p class="quotation">Randolph uses the vampire-cyborg mythology to 
    interrogate the undead psychoanalytic, spiritual, and mundane zones where 
    bio-medecine, information technology, and the techno-organic stories of 
    kinship converge. This is the kinship exchange system in which gender, race, 
    and species-animal and machine-are all at stake. Joining the pulsing fluids 
    of blood and data,<i>Transfusions</i>guides us through the interrogation of 
    universal donors. (Haraway, &quot;Race. Universal Donors.&quot;, 216-17) </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Note that the vampire in this film is not so much Jesús 
    Gris, or even Señor de la Guardia, as the hybrid machine-organism itself. In 
    a moving passage of Nina Auerbach's fantastic compendium of vampire 
    mythology,<i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i>, its title of course citing the 
    &quot;our bodies, ourselves&quot; logo, she examines the sick vampires of postmodern 
    culture with some nostalgia, seeing them as an endangered species: </p>

    <p class="quotation">[Q4] In Hambly's<i>Those Who Hunt the Night</i>, 
    London's vampires are being murdered en masse: an amateur detective must 
    save them from the manufactured vampire who feeds on them. In a culture 
    turning from humanism to computers and cyborgs, in which authentic 
    transcendence is associated not with nature or bodies, but with &quot;a 
    cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social 
    reality as well as a creature of fiction,&quot; even uninfected vampires are 
    debilitated because trapped in outmoded organicism. Originally unnatural, 
    vampires as a species are now abandoned in a nature withering before 
    fabricated cybernetic brains. (Auerbach, 177) </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">Although representational 
    culture, the culture of the Book, is still present in<i>Cronos</i>, in the 
    form of the ancient alchemist's manuscript, it is peculiarly redundant as 
    its apparently strict rules are never followed, or never seem to matter, 
    while the old Señor de la Guardia ends up eating its pages: &quot;Best meal I've 
    had in years&quot;, he says in English to a resuscitated Jesús whose flesh he 
    peels off like so many layers of decayed cosmetics in a clip we'll see in a 
    moment. </p>

    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">To summarize the argument I've been putting 
    forward in this paper: I have tried to identify in these two films an 
    attempt to capture, in very different ways, the spatio-temporal rifts 
    experienced in the megapolis. Although it is a partial, compressed and 
    contradictory process, both films appear to be tracing out the 
    spatio-temporal boundaries where the twin logic of representation and 
    production phases into and out of a recursive order of simulation and 
    replication. </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">So, I am going to end now 
    with a compendium of clips from<i>Cronos</i>, some of them a little bit 
    gruesome, and I'd be very interested to know how many trans-cinematic 
    citations you can locate in these clips, because the simulated 
    cyborg-vampires, the recursive bodies within bodies, of this film are in my 
    view quite clearly part of a postmodern pastiche, as is the film's narrative 
    itself, with its allusions to a transcendental morality play (the names of 
    the characters - Jesus, Angel, Aurora), Hollywood rooftop chases amidst the 
    neon signs of the postmodern city (<i>Blade Runner</i>is somewhere there), 
    and a belated almost comic appeal to humanism at the end when Jesús crushes 
    the Chronos device with a rock, so condemning himself with some relief to 
    mortality. So here are the clips:</span> </p>
